The included images are based upon the GooseMod compilation built by Snowy. Many thanks to both them as well as all the artists and contributors for their creations and for giving permission to use their backgrounds and foregrounds as presets within DoL+'s DecoMod.

While there are 300 slots that can be used in this version (instructions are provided within the mod's menu itself -  click the blue question mark in the menu), only a few of the slots are filled out to start with. Either with a blank or with an actual image. Gotta conserve server space. If you see a red exclamation mark after selecting an image slot, that just means there's no image in that particular slot. So you can just clear the error or replace the slot with your own image.

If you see your art in here and you'd like to be either be credited or have the art removed, please notify me (J-Side) via Discord. Pretty sure I tracked down and contacted everyone who's art is in here, but I may have missed someone, so... just in case.

Finally, if you'd like to find more backgrounds and foregrounds to accessorize your character, feel free to check out the dolmods discord. Thank you for your all your support. Have fun with the DecoMod!
